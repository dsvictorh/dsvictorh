I have learned that knowing a little of everything is the foundation of a good developer, especially when it comes to teamwork, but nothing is better than a team of specialists. Companies who look for the "full stack" guys don't really care for the concept of the best man for the job.

Being a developer is constantly learning, doing new things just because it grabbed your attention, the best places to work don't take your improvement and learning curve on new ways to do things as a liability but rather an opportunity.

I'm not a fan of losing time on setting up an overcomplicated environment: straight to the point, friendly and quick setups. Some people like to do the Guru stuff and be awesome at setting up these complicated environments. I'm not one of them. Should the need of a more robust environment rise I will implement it, however my MO for these things tends to be "Only What Is Necessary". That being said in some front end aspects I often find more problems than solutions with out of the box visual libraries and components, I prefer to spend some extra time creating my own and avoiding future issues. I have an amazing eye for detecting flaws in UIs and overall User Experience.

I focus on the foundation of raw languages and tools, that allows me to move around different technologies based on the same core concepts. Despite my preferred technologies I can quickly learn any alternative applying this principle.
