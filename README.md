# VÃ­ctor Herrera

I have an extensive background in complex and scalable web applications/APIs, focusing on simple yet powerful architectures designed using fundamental programming concepts. This allows me to quickly adapt to any language and framework implementing best practices as well bending paradigms to fit the specific needs of any project.
